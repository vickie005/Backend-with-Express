# Express Backend Project

A lightweight Node.js backend built with Express.js. This project currently serves as the foundation for handling API routes and server-side logic.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Node.js 
pm (comes bundled with Node)

### Installation
**Clone the repository:*
git clone https://github.com/vickie005/Backend-with-Express
cd Backend-with-Express

*Install dependencies:*
This command reads the package.json file and installs all necessary modules (like Express) into your local node_modules folder.
npm install
npm install --save-dev nodemon

**Run the server:*
node index.js
The server should now be running at http://localhost:3000 (or your specified port).
